They today mainly come from Angola, Brazil, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Equatorial Guinea, Ghana, Gambia, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal. Additionally, many Afro-Spaniards born in Spain are from the former Spanish colony Equatorial Guinea. Today, there are an estimated 683,000 Afro-Spaniards in Spain."
What is key to getting the skills needed for high demand jobs?,"<answer> access to education <context> An important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals' access to education. Education, especially in an area where there is a high demand for workers, creates high wages for those with this education, however, increases in education first increase and then decrease growth as well as income inequality. As a result, those who are unable to afford an education, or choose not to pursue optional education, generally receive much lower wages. The justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes, and thus lower aggregate savings and investment. Conversely, education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor."
What's the name of the owner of the company?,"<answer> have been with Mr. Compton <context> CHAPTER XVIII. 

THE EFFICIENCY EXPERT. 

Unlike most other plants the International Machine Company paid on Monday, and it was on the Monday following his assumption of his new duties that Jimmy had his first clash with Bince. He had been talking with Everett, the cashier, whom, in accordance with his ""method,"" he was studying. From Everett he had learned that it was pay-day and he had asked the cashier to let him see the pay-roll. 

""I don't handle the pay-roll,"" replied Everett a trifle peevishly. ""Shortly after Mr. Bince was made assistant general manager a new rule was promulgated, to the effect that all salaries and wages were to be considered as confidential and that no one but the assistant general manager would handle the pay-rolls. All I know is the amount of the weekly check. He hires and fires everybody and pays everybody."" 

""Rather unusual, isn't it?"" commented Jimmy. 

""Very,"" said Everett. ""Here's some of us have been with Mr. Compton since Bince was in long clothes, and then he comes in here and says that we are not to be trusted with the pay-roll."" 

""Well,"" said Jimmy, ""I shall have to go to him to see it then."" 

""He won't show it to you,"" said Everett. 

""Oh, I guess he will,"" said Jimmy, and a moment later he knocked at Bince's office door. When Bince saw who it was he turned back to his work with a grunt. 

""I am sorry, Torrance,"" he said, ""but I can't talk with you just now. I'm very busy."" "
how much commission should a real estate agent get for just selling a property?,"<answer> The commission is set as a percentage of the home's sales price. Most selling agents will ask for a commission of 6%, to be split 50-50 with the buyer's agent who will thus receive 3%. <context> Negotiating the amount you pay to your real estate agent could therefore be the easiest way to save money. In a typical home sale, each party -- the buyer and the seller -- works with his or her own real estate agent. But it's the seller who generally pays the commission for both real estate agents from the proceeds of the sale. When listing your home with an agent, you have an opportunity to set the amount of commission both agents will receive. The commission is set as a percentage of the home's sales price. Most selling agents will ask for a commission of 6%, to be split 50-50 with the buyer's agent (who will thus receive 3%). Reducing your commission as little as 0.5% could result in big savings -- for example, saving 0.5% on a $400,000 home sale would be an additional $2,000 in your pocket."
Why did the economy begin to expand?,"<answer> a surplus in production <context> It is widely assumed that architectural success was the product of a process of trial and error, with progressively less trial and more replication as the results of the process proved increasingly satisfactory. What is termed vernacular architecture continues to be produced in many parts of the world. Indeed, vernacular buildings make up most of the built world that people experience every day. Early human settlements were mostly rural. Due to a surplus in production the economy began to expand resulting in urbanization thus creating urban areas which grew and evolved very rapidly in some cases, such as that of Çatal Höyük in Anatolia and Mohenjo Daro of the Indus Valley Civilization in modern-day Pakistan."
is MLS always successful fiancincally?,"<answer> financial and operational struggles <context> Major League Soccer (MLS) is a men's professional soccer league, sanctioned by U.S. Soccer, that represents the sport's highest level in both the United States and Canada. MLS constitutes one of the major professional sports leagues of the United States and Canada. The league comprises 22 teams—19 in the U.S. and 3 in Canada. The MLS regular season runs from March to October, with each team playing 34 games; the team with the best record is awarded the Supporters' Shield. The postseason includes twelve teams competing in the MLS Cup Playoffs through November and December, culminating in the championship game, the MLS Cup. MLS teams also play in other domestic competitions against teams from other divisions in the U.S. Open Cup and in the Canadian Championship. MLS teams also compete against continental rivals in the CONCACAF Champions League. 

Major League Soccer was founded in 1993 as part of the United States' successful bid to host the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The first season took place in 1996 with ten teams. MLS experienced financial and operational struggles in its first few years: The league lost millions of dollars, teams played in mostly empty American football stadiums, and two teams folded in 2002. Since then, MLS has expanded to 22 teams, owners built soccer-specific stadiums, average MLS attendance exceeds that of the National Hockey League (NHL) and National Basketball Association (NBA), MLS secured national TV contracts, and the league is now profitable."
What was one appointment receive?,"<answer> appointment as Astrologer <context> CHAPTER IV 

OF THE WAYS OF CHARMION; AND OF THE CROWNING OF HARMACHIS AS THE KING OF LOVE 

On the following day I received the writing of my appointment as Astrologer and Magician-in-Chief to the Queen, with the pay and perquisites of that office, which were not small. Rooms were given me in the palace, also, through which I passed at night to the high watch-tower, whence I looked on the stars and drew their auguries. For at this time Cleopatra was much troubled about matters political, and not knowing how the great struggle among the Roman factions would end, but being very desirous to side with the strongest, she took constant counsel with me as to the warnings of the stars. These I read to her in such manner as best seemed to fit the high interest of my ends. For Antony, the Roman Triumvir, was now in Asia Minor, and, rumour ran, very wroth because it had been told him that Cleopatra was hostile to the Triumvirate, in that her General, Serapion, had aided Cassius. But Cleopatra protested loudly to me and others that Serapion had acted against her will. Yet Charmion told me that, as with Allienus, it was because of a prophecy of Dioscorides the unlucky that the Queen herself had secretly ordered Serapion so to do. Still, this did not save Serapion, for to prove to Antony that she was innocent she dragged the General from the sanctuary and slew him. Woe be to those who carry out the will of tyrants if the scale should rise against them! And so Serapion perished. "
Orientalism refers to how the West developed a what of the East?,"<answer> an imaginative geography <context> Orientalism, as theorized by Edward Said, refers to how the West developed an imaginative geography of the East. This imaginative geography relies on an essentializing discourse that represents neither the diversity nor the social reality of the East. Rather, by essentializing the East, this discourse uses the idea of place-based identities to create difference and distance between ""we"" the West and ""them"" the East, or ""here"" in the West and ""there"" in the East. This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient that positioned the East as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive West. Defining the East as a negative vision of itself, as its inferior, not only increased the West’s sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so that it could be dominated and controlled. The discourse of Orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism, as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other territories."

What is the difference between innate and acquired behaviors?,<answer> Innate behavior means that the behavior is inheritable or genetically programs where as Acquired behavior means the behavior is learned from external enviroment and is not inheritable. <context> Best Answer: Innate behavior means that the behavior is inheritable or genetically programs. Example: the behavior of many insect toward attracting mates such as cricket sounds or frog sounds are innate behaviors. Acquired behavior means the behavior is learned from external enviroment and is not inheritable. Example: human learns how to hunt. So hunting is an acquired behavior.
In what period did Africa beak off from Antarctica?,"<answer> Jurassic <context> Africa separated from Antarctica in the Jurassic, around 160 Ma, followed by the Indian subcontinent in the early Cretaceous (about 125 Ma). By the end of the Cretaceous, about 66 Ma, Antarctica (then connected to Australia) still had a subtropical climate and flora, complete with a marsupial fauna. In the Eocene epoch, about 40 Ma Australia-New Guinea separated from Antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate Antarctica from Australia, and the first ice began to appear. During the Eocene–Oligocene extinction event about 34 million years ago, CO2 levels have been found to be about 760 ppm and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm."
What are the symptoms of hard of hearing?,"<answer> 1 difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say, especially in group situations. 2 asking people to repeat themselves. 3 listening to music or watching television with the volume higher than other people need. <context> General signs of hearing loss. Early signs of hearing loss can include: 1  difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say, especially in group situations. 2  asking people to repeat themselves. 3  listening to music or watching television with the volume higher than other people need."
Which type of birds use tools to drum?,"<answer> palm <context> Calls are used for a variety of purposes, including mate attraction, evaluation of potential mates, bond formation, the claiming and maintenance of territories, the identification of other individuals (such as when parents look for chicks in colonies or when mates reunite at the start of breeding season), and the warning of other birds of potential predators, sometimes with specific information about the nature of the threat. Some birds also use mechanical sounds for auditory communication. The Coenocorypha snipes of New Zealand drive air through their feathers, woodpeckers drum territorially, and palm cockatoos use tools to drum."
"According to West, what can people learn from music?","<answer> Teamwork and patience. <context> Public schools in Washington, D.C. provide students with musical instruments for free. When something goes wrong with an instrument, Charles West and Larry Jernigan do the repairs. Both men approach their work with a passion . For them, it's important that students have a joyful experience with music.
The two have worked together for almost 20 years. This year alone, they've fixed about 450 instruments. Both men are musicians and music lovers, so learning to do repairs came naturally.
""I have been a musician all my life."" says West. ""I played in an orchestra here in the city. I majored in music in college. I played in an army band.""
Jernigan's musical interests are varied. ""I was formerly trained in the piano and guitar. The alto sax, and the flute, I picked up while working here.""
In addition to fixing instruments, the two also go to schools to instruct teachers and students on how to make minor repairs on their own.
West believes if children start early and stay concerned with music, it enriches other areas of their lives. ""I see that in other kids. I see it in myself. I have seen it hundreds of times and it works,"" he says. ""They learn teamwork. They learn patience and respect.""
But West has concerns about the future of music in the electronic age.
""This instant age has taken away from the sit-down, the patience. And to learn to play an instrument, it takes patience, it takes diligence, it takes time.""
Being able to enjoy music on the job is one of the benefits of the job. Both men agree their best rewards are the students' performances."
How long did the research last?,"<answer> About seven years <context> Everyone knows that regular bedtimes are important, especially for children. But a research by Yvonne Kelly of University College, London, shows that daughters, it seems, do benefit from regular bedtimes. Sons do not.
Dr Kelly and a team of colleagues examined the bedtimes and cognitive  abilities of 11,178 children born in Britain between September 2000 and January 2002, who took part in a research project called the Millennium Cohort Study.
The bedtime information they used was collected during four visits interviewers made to the homes of those participating in the study. These happened when the children were nine months, three years, five years and seven years of age. Besides asking whether the children had set bedtimes on weekdays and if they always, usually, sometimes or never made them, interviewers collected information about family routines, economic circumstances and other matters--including whether children were read to before they went to sleep and whether they had a television in their bedroom. The children in question were also asked, at the ages of three, five and seven, to take standardised reading, mathematical tests, from which their IQs could be tested.
Dr Kelly's report shows that by the time children had reached the age of seven, not having had a regular bedtime did seem to affect their cognition. But that was true only if they were female. On the IQ scale, whose average value is 100 points, girls who had had regular bedtimes scored between eight and nine points more than those who did not. Boys were not completely unaffected. Irregular bedtimes left their IQs about six points below those of their contemporaries at the age of three. But the distinction disappeared by the time they were seven.
This difference between the sexes is puzzling. ""I did not expect it, and more research is necessary."" said Dr Kelly."
"when it is spring in the northern hemisphere, what is it in the southern?","<answer> Northern hemisphere spring begins on 1 March while at same time there is autumn in the southern. <context> Therefore, for temperate areas in the northern hemisphere, spring begins on 1 March, summer on 1 June, autumn on 1 September, and winter on 1 December. For the southern hemisphere temperate zone, spring begins on 1 September, summer on 1 December, autumn on 1 March, and winter on 1 June. This question is archived."
Who was the inventor of water turbines?,"<answer> Muslim engineers <context> Muslim engineers in the Islamic world made a number of innovative industrial uses of hydropower, and early industrial uses of tidal power and wind power, fossil fuels such as petroleum, and early large factory complexes (tiraz in Arabic). The industrial uses of watermills in the Islamic world date back to the 7th century, while horizontal-wheeled and vertical-wheeled water mills were both in widespread use since at least the 9th century. A variety of industrial mills were being employed in the Islamic world, including early fulling mills, gristmills, hullers, sawmills, ship mills, stamp mills, steel mills, sugar mills, tide mills and windmills. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial mills in operation, from al-Andalus and North Africa to the Middle East and Central Asia. Muslim engineers also invented crankshafts and water turbines, employed gears in mills and water-raising machines, and pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines. Such advances made it possible for industrial tasks that were previously driven by manual labour in ancient times to be mechanized and driven by machinery instead in the medieval Islamic world. The transfer of these technologies to medieval Europe had an influence on the Industrial Revolution."
how did scholars decipher egyptian hieroglyphs?,"<answer> Decipherment relied on  literal translation of the images they saw. <context> In later centuries, scholars who saw the hieroglyphs tried to interpret them, but they were hindered by a false hypothesis. They assumed that hieroglyphs were nothing more than primitive picture writing, and that their decipherment relied on a literal translation of the images they saw."
Who voted to ban women's football from its grounds in 1921?,"<answer> England's Football Association <context> The growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both national and international level mirroring the male competitions. Women's football has faced many struggles. It had a ""golden age"" in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches; this was stopped on 5 December 1921 when England's Football Association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs. The FA's ban was rescinded in December 1969 with UEFA voting to officially recognise women's football in 1971. The FIFA Women's World Cup was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since, while women's football has been an Olympic event since 1996."
What should women do if they are using antibiotics and birth control pills?,"<answer> extra contraceptive measures <context> The majority of studies indicate antibiotics do interfere with contraceptive pills, such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low (about 1%). In cases where antibacterials have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills, such as for the broad-spectrum antibacterial rifampicin, these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes' causing increased breakdown of the pill's active ingredients. Effects on the intestinal flora, which might result in reduced absorption of estrogens in the colon, have also been suggested, but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial. Clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibacterials that are suspected to interact with oral contraceptives."

What did every one one of his muscles do?,"<answer> Every muscle seemed to ache, <context> CHAPTER XIV 

THE CURE 

It was noon when Harding returned to camp, ragged and exhausted, with Clarke limping after him in an even more pitiable state. The latter had suffered badly from the hurried march, but his conductor would brook no delay and the grim hints he had been given encouraged him to the utmost exertion he was capable of. Blake was alive, but when Harding bent over him he feared that help had come too late. His skin looked harsh and dry, his face had grown hollow, and his thick strong hair had turned lank and was falling out. His eyes were vacant and unrecognizing when he turned them upon Harding. 

""Here's your patient,"" the American said to Clarke. ""We expect you to cure him, and you had better get to work at once."" Then his face grew troubled as he asked Benson: ""How long has he been like that?"" 

""The last two days,"" said Benson. ""I'm afraid he's very bad."" 

Harding sat down with a smothered groan. Every muscle seemed to ache, he could scarcely hold himself upright, and his heart was heavy. He would miss Blake terribly; it was hard to think of going on without him, but he feared that this was inevitable. He was filled with a deep pity for the helpless man, but after a few moments his weary face grew stern. He had done all that he was able, and now Clarke, whom he believed to be a man of high medical skill, must do his part. If he were unsuccessful, it would be the worse for him. "
Did they know her?,"<answer> ""Why has he never spoken to _us_ of his sister?"" she asked. 
 <context> CHAPTER XLVII. DEBATING. 

In the meanwhile Emily had been true to her promise to relieve Mirabel's anxieties, on the subject of Miss Jethro. Entering the drawing-room in search of Alban, she found him talking with Cecilia, and heard her own name mentioned as she opened the door. 

""Here she is at last!"" Cecilia exclaimed. ""What in the world has kept you all this time in the rose garden?"" 

""Has Mr. Mirabel been more interesting than usual?"" Alban asked gayly. Whatever sense of annoyance he might have felt in Emily's absence, was forgotten the moment she appeared; all traces of trouble in his face vanished when they looked at each other. 

""You shall judge for yourself,"" Emily replied with a smile. ""Mr. Mirabel has been speaking to me of a relative who is very dear to him--his sister."" 

Cecilia was surprised. ""Why has he never spoken to _us_ of his sister?"" she asked. 

""It's a sad subject to speak of, my dear. His sister lives a life of suffering--she has been for years a prisoner in her room. He writes to her constantly. His letters from Monksmoor have interested her, poor soul. It seems he said something about me--and she has sent a kind message, inviting me to visit her one of these days. Do you understand it now, Cecilia?"" 

""Of course I do! Tell me--is Mr. Mirabel's sister older or younger than he is?"" 

""Older."" 

""Is she married?"" 

""She is a widow."" 

""Does she live with her brother?"" Alban asked. 

""Oh, no! She has her own house--far away in Northumberland."" "
